# readiLIB

This is a simple little utility lib providing functions that I used quite often while developing Back2Home and therefore I wanted to make them available to (my) other (upcoming) addons as well.

## FEATURES

This LIB provides utility factory functions for the following UI elements

- OptionPanels _creating addon option panels to be added to the `SettingsPanel` Window_
- Buttons
- Dropdowns
- Checkboxes
- RadioButtons
- EditBoxes
- Sliders

### Additionally it provides handlers for ...

- errors - to easily validate the properties given to the function or the factories
- textures - along with a table of commonly used own textures
- localization - obviously for localizing the UI
- colors - to easily get hex-codes for commonly used colors
- reporting - for debugging and notifications
